# About Me

I am a PHP/Symfony developer with over 9 years of experience in web development. Currently at SensioLabs, I have had the opportunity to work on various projects for demanding sectors: banks, public services, e-commerce and French press.

My specialization in Symfony (certified Expert on versions 6 and 7) allows me to work on complex architectures, critical migrations and large-scale technical overhauls. I particularly enjoy technical challenges that go beyond the usual scope: Domain-Driven Design, AWS Lambda deployments, integrations with technologies like ElasticSearch, Redis or RabbitMQ.

## My journey

My experience has been built around ambitious technical projects. I have notably participated in the multi-year overhaul of a major French bank's intranet, developed DDD backend applications hosted on AWS Lambda for a major press publisher, and supported the progressive migration of critical platforms for public services.

This diversity of contexts has allowed me to develop solid technical expertise, but also an ability to adapt to complex environments and specific business constraints. Whether it's modernizing legacy systems, designing robust APIs or optimizing performance on high-traffic applications, I enjoy taking on technical challenges that require creativity and rigor.

## My vision of development

I believe that code quality and collaboration are the foundations of a job well done. Each project is an opportunity to learn, share and improve my practices. I attach particular importance to technical design freedom, which allows proposing solutions adapted to real needs rather than standardized responses.

Mutual aid between developers and knowledge sharing are an integral part of my way of working. It is in this spirit that I regularly share my thoughts and feedback through technical articles on this site. My goal is to contribute to a technical community where everyone can progress and flourish.
